        <p>Note: Don’t bother painting the backplate strength piece or any side of a piece you aren’t going to see.
            (Read full assembly instructions before starting)</p>
        <p>Sand all the parts with grit 120 then apply 2 coats with acrylic filler spray.</p>
        <p>Before applying the second layer wait minimum 120 min. After the second layer wait at least 24h before start
            sanding. About 90% of the filler coats should be removed with the sanding. The filler supposed to fill only
            the thin gaps between the layers.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aQMq0Q6.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Sanding grit steps:</p>
        <p>120 → 180 → 240 → 320 → 400 → 600</p>
        <p>Always sand wet, because the PLA can melt from the heat of sanding. After sanding you should have similar
            result:</p>

        <h2 id="clutch">Clutch</h2>
        <p>Mount the clutch paddle to the clutch lever with 2x M3x8mm Hex Countersunk Screw. The screws should be used
            as self-cutting screws tighten directly into the 3D printed part. If the holes are too small you can drill
            with 2.5mm drill bit or cut thread with M3 cutter. After fixing the shifter lever to the paddle, glue the
            Ø12x5mm Magnet in place with superglue.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l63zjsy.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Put 2x M3 Nut into the holes of the clutch body and glue the Ø12x5mm Magnet in with superglue.</p>
        <p><strong>Pay attention to magnet polarity. It should repel the clutch lever.</strong></p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BUWyLdi.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Mount one side wall to the clutch body with 2x M3x8mm Hex Button Head Screw.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2ezSkX7.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Mount the potentiometer to the already mounted side wall like the picture shows below. The potentiometer
            should be rotated 15° from the vertical position, to have place for the screw which goes into the upper
            hole. If the positioner pin of the potentiometer stands it off from the clutch side, it should be cut. You
            can use screw fastener under the potentiometer to avoid the rotation of it later.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FfQhg3o.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Turn the shaft of the potentiometer fully left (like shown on the left-side picture below). (For the
            right-side clutch reverse.) The clutch lever should be pushed onto the shaft as shown on the right-side
            picture below. So, the potentiometer shaft should be moved almost from the starting position, but leaving
            10-15° range.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8SAXcXY.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Then push the clutch lever onto the potentiometer shaft like shown above.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8PIfsnc.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Mount the other side wall to the clutch body with 2x M3x8mm Hex Button Head Screw.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ih2JvC2.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Mount the M3x30mm Hex Socket Screw with M3 Locknut which is responsible for the end position.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6GGmUNI.png" alt=""></p>
        <h2 id="shifter">Shifter</h2>
        <p>Assemble the shifter according to the blow diagram. Magnets should attract each other.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mxyRLHC.png" alt=""></p>
        <h2 id="full-assembly">Full Assembly</h2>
        <p>Backplate:</p>
        <p>Yellow mark – Countersunk M5 screw (Connects to M5 standoff)<br>
            Blue mark – Countersunk M4 screw (Joins both front plates together)<br>
            Green mark – Countersunk M3 screw (Connects to side walls)</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/maWuqjg.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Frontplate:</p>
        <p>Yellow mark – Countersunk M5 screw (Connects to M5 standoff)<br>
            Blue mark – Countersunk M4 screw (Joins both front plates together)<br>
            Green mark – Countersunk M3 screw (Joins both front plates together)</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Irli9RX.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Fasten the side walls to the backplate with M3x10mm countersunk screws and M3 nuts.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WTlNevq.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Fasten the backplate strength part to the backplate. This is also the point where you should mount your
            wheelbase adapter. Use M5 screws and nuts. Screws must be the correct length for your adapter (not
            supplied).</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5BK9YMw.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
        <p>Fasten the rear part of grips with M5x15mm countersunk screws and M5 nuts to the backplate.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OQMSG0h.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Put in the side encoders. You should have enough thread to screw on the nut to secure the encoder. Fine
            pointed pliers can help. Encoder with only 1 cable goes to the top, encoder with 2 cables to the sides.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/reDEtaR.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Mount the shifters and clutch to the rear of the wheel. Clutch uses M3x10mm Hex Button Head Screw &amp;
            Shifters use M3x8mm screws. If you aren’t using clutches, filling the mount holes with the appropriate screw
            and nut looks good.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uW61wxK.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Mount the GX16 4pin circular connector to the backplate. The GX16 won’t be long enough to secure with a nut
            although the friction fit is tight, glue can be used here to further secure.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EX9Tw9b.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Connect the side rotary encoders, the shifters, grip button cables and the USB cable (circular 4 pin
            connector) to the PCB. Put the PCB in place and fasten it with M3x5mm screws.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yAXDRzI.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Fasten the front plate to the already assembled housing with M5x15mm countersunk screws &amp; M5 spacers.</p>
        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QWsoQ1p.png" alt=""></p>
        <hr>
        <p>At this stage I recommend plugging in and testing your wheel. At this point it is easy to disassemble it if
            you have any issues but you should be able to test all features.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Place the grip button into the front part of the grips. Check the direction according the front plate cutout!
            (red marked) The pins of the buttons should stay according the cutout of the frontplate!</p>
        <p>The plastic position pins can be cut from the button. Solder the buttons to the wires (yellow) and move the
            front grip in place.</p>
        <p>Push the left wires into the hole in rear part of the grip. Don’t leave more than 2-3cm wire, because won’t
            fit in. If you want to disassemble the wheel, always unsolder the grip buttons first.</p>
        <p>This step is unfortunately needed, because the rear part of the grip is also connected to the backplate to
            make it stronger. So the rear part of the grip is between the PCB and backplate</p>

        <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rFCaFrF.png" alt=""></p>
        <p>Finally, Attach the front plexiglass &amp; button surrounds with double sided tape.</p>
